\section{Interrupt Service Routine Setup}

\subsection{Reset Handler}

The Reset-Handler is defined in the Assembler-File and is a Non-Maskable Interrupt with the lowest Priority of all Interrupts.
Low Priority in this case means it will override Interrupts with higher Priority.\\
During Reset the Stack-Pointer has to be reset and then the main-Routine from main.c has to be called.

\subsection{Interrupt Service Routine Definitions}

At the End of the Assembler-File are ".weak"-Definitions which are basically Prototypes for Functions which should be defined by other Parts of the Code.

The "hang"-Function puts the STM32F030F4 into an endless loop. This is intentional to indicate that an unknown Error has occurred because "hang" should never be called.
