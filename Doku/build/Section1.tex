\section{Project Description}
\label{sec:ProjDesc}

The goal of the project is to program a STM32F030F4-Chip to send Measurement-Data
to a MAX485 which is a RS485-Transceiver using the STM32's USART3-Interface.\\ \\
The STM32 is connected to the MAX485 through Pins PC10 and PC11.\\ \\
After the STM32 receives a Byte from the MAX485, it is supposed to send back
ten Measurement-Points from the ADC using Interrupts.\\
The MAX485 defines the Connection-Parameters of the USART :
\begin{itemize}
	\item 38400 Baudrate
	\item 8 Data-Bits
	\item 1 Stop-Bit
	\item Odd-Parity
\end{itemize}

The Project is available on \href{https://github.com/davirieser/uC_Comm}{GitHub}.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{subsec:RS_Over}

RS485 is a OSI-Layer 1 Protocol, this means it defines the Voltage-Levels and
physical Capabilities for Protocols which rely on it.
