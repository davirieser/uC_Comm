\section{Project Desription}

The goal of the project is to program a STM32F030F4-Chip to send Measurement-Data
to a MAX485 which is a RS485-Transceiver using the STM32's USART3-Interface.\\ \\
The STM32 is connected to the MAX485 through Pins PC10 and PC11.\\ \\
After the STM32 receives a Byte from the MAX485, it is supposed to send back
ten Measurement-Points from the ADC using Interrupts.\\
The MAX485 defines the Connection-Parameters of the USART :
\begin{itemize}
	\item 38400 Baudrate
	\item 8 Data-Bits
	\item 1 Stop-Bit
	\item Odd-Parity
\end{itemize}
